## 3. Data Visualization
### 3.1 Introduction

Using ggplot2, which uses grammar of graphics for describing and building graphs
`r library(tidyverse)`

### 3.2 First Steps
Question: Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?
  + is the relationship positive/negative, linear/nonlinear?
  
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

mpg

# To plot mpg
ggplot(data = mpg) + # this line tells R to use the mpg dataset
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) # this line tells R to create a layer on the base plot, and what variable to plot on each axis
```
